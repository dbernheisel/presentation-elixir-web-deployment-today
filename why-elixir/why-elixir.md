# Nostalgia and Programming Patterns

## Introduction

[speaking head]

When we recognize music, movies, old photos, or video games of the past, it has
a powerful effect: nostalgia. It's a pattern of the past that we remember
fondly.

When we write code, we recall patterns of the past to consider as tools to help
solve today's problem.

I'd like to explore the connection between software development and nostalgia,
and have some fun while we're exploring the theory.

## What is Nostalgia

The word "nostalgia" started as a medical condition. Doctors invented the word
with the Greek roots 'nostos', meaning returning home, and 'algos' meaning
pain. It was invented in 1688, when Swiss soldiers would miss home so much,
that they would mentally break down, and no longer be able to 'be a soldier';
they longed for who they used to be.

Nostalgia today is much less than a medical condition, and now considered
a temporary emotion, usually triggered by some sense, like sight or sound. The
word is no longer associated with the negative effects to the person; in fact
quite the opposite; it now means "fondly remembering the past".

Inducing nostalgia can boost psychological well-being; increase feelings of
self-esteem and **social belonging**, encourage psychological growth. Nostalgia
can be a restorative way of coping with negative stress.

Marketing knows about nostalgia; it's a powerful selling tool. There are 11
Star Wars films; 10 Batman movies; 16 Final Fantasy games. Remasters of
remasters, remakes on top of remakes. [Remixes of older
songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNYGLMQxZ64); you get it. Generally,
folks **want** to be in that mental space.

## Where Nostalgia Comes From

![Lifespan Retrieval Curve](./Lifespan_Retrieval_Curve.jpg)

This is called the [Lifespan Retrieval
Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reminiscence_bump).

- 0-5yrs Childhood Amnesia
- 10-30yrs Reminisence Bump (this is our nostalgic period)
- 30+ Period of Recency

Our autobiographical memory -- that is, our psychological history of ourselves
-- on average shows that most of our memories are formed between the ages of
10-30 years old. Younger than 10 is considered childhood amnesia; greater than
that is considered too recent. For the life of me, I can't remember what being
6 was like; I remember snippets like riding my bike around the neighborhood in
odd moments of self-reflection. Likewise, I couldn't tell you what I did
2 years ago that affected my life profoundly. It's unconsciously regarded as
too recent to be formative of "who I am."

Our young adulthood is where we develop our self-identity; it's when we
discover who we are and want to be. We'll come back around to that bit. For me,
the time period is the 1990s and 2000s.

[cut to 90s]

Back in the 1990s, there were several things that I did:

- Listened to cassettes I recorded from the stereo on my fuzzy earphones.
- Stopped at every Magic Eye book in Books-a-million, Borders, Hastings, or
  Barnes & Noble to see if I could see "it".
- Spent 30 minutes or more just trying to decide what movie to rent; maybe it
  took so long because I couldn't accept that the movie I wanted to see didn't
  have the VHS behind it.
- Got really excited when the phone rang.
- Watched Bewitched and Dick Van Dyke on Nick-at-night.
- Replayed in my head the "The Log Song" from Ren & Stimpy. It was an earworm
  that never left. To this day I still hum it. If it wasn't that song, it was
  "Blue" by Eiffel 65.
- I cleaned up poop from my Tamagotchi, jumped on goombas, and a little latter
  double-barrel shotgunned demons in Doom.

Let's stop at that last point: video games.

## [Theory of Fun](https://www.theoryoffun.com/)

[Super Mario gameplay]

Super Mario. The hero plumber that would grow up to be the most iconic and
recognizable video game character of all time. Made by a company formed in
1889: Nintendo.

Video games are a source of nostalgia for many people. They're fun. They're
a way to escape the stress of the day. Many video games, such as Final Fantasy,
are epic stories that we can get lost within; just like books but these are
interactive! Others, like classic Mario, have very little story and just focus
on addictive game mechanics.

Video games are developed to be fun; otherwise why would we play them? Most
gamers aren't playing for pure punishment (looking at you, Mega Man 9). Turns
out, there's a lot of social science that goes into designing games to get and
keep players!

The book "Theory of Fun" outlines some basics of what it takes to create a good
game. In it, the author Raph Koster includes a quote by Chris Crawford saying:

> fun is the emotional response to learning

And later Raph Koster:

> Fun in games arises out of mastery. It arises out of comprehension. It is the
> act of solving puzzles that makes games fun. With games, learning is the
> drug.

> The idea was, games are systems built to help us learn patterns, and fun is
> a neurochemical reward to encourage us to keep trying.

These games teach us patterns, and then delightfully introduce variations on
them, which keeps us learning. We see new situations as the game progresses,
and have new ways to apply the learned patterns to them; or perhaps combine
patterns.

Let's look at an example.

[Super Mario Bros - Level One]

In the original Super Mario Bros, we know that Mario moves right to advance to the goal; we can tell because he's on the left side of the screen, and you can't go left; you must go right.

The game introduces a pattern by establishing if you touch the Goombas, you
die. Noted-- don't touch bad guys.

Let's try pushing one of the buttons on the gamepad. Turns out Mario can jump!
Let's avoid those bad guys. Noted-- I can move right and jump

There are blocks now. Looks like if I jump into them, I might get something. If I jump on top, it acts as a platform.

It introduces a pattern by establishing if you touch the mushroom, you grow.
Noted-- there are power-ups that make me stronger

You experiment with two elements: Getting a mushroom, and then touching the enemy. Turns out that's a mistake and now you shrink back down. Noted-- can't kill bad guys by only being big.

You experiment with two more elements: jump on the enemy's heads!. Noted-- bad guys can be jumped on.

Now we're at a pit. Probably not safe to go in there, but maybe the screen will move down and reveal a new area. Let's try. Noted-- can't go down pits.

These are universal patterns now in games. We know instinctively that we just don't touch enemies, and we should jump over pits.

## Patterns are Fun

Earlier we talked about nostalgia. Remember, nostalgia is fondly
**remembering** the past. It's remembering a pattern that may be long gone from
our current life.

Like nostalgia, video games also has some psychological benefits. "Theory of
Fun" includes [a study from 2011 released by East Carolina
University](https://news.ecu.edu/2011/02/16/study-casual-video-games-demonstrate-ability-to-reduce-depression-and-anxiety/),
that found that casual gamers who played in 30 minute periods showed an 87%
improvement in cognitive response time, reduced depression symptoms by 57%, and
215% increase in executive functioning. That's incredible!

I'm starting to get the idea that nostalgia and video games are good news for
our brains and well-being. This isn't limited to video games either; although I'm focusing on them; these taught patterns also exist in music and movies.

Thinking about pop music, almost every song on the radio has a recognizable
pattern, whether you've picked it out or not:

- Intro
- Verse 1
- Chorus
- Verse 2
- Chorus
- Bridge
- Chorus
- Outro

If we analyzed the notes themselves, there are patterns of notes that musicians
know sound good together called scales. Notes played that are not on the given
scale will create a harsh sound creating dissonance; an out-of-tune guitar, for
example.

Likewise, movies and books typically follow a pattern:

- Introduce characters and setting
- Rising action or inciting incident.
- Climax and Falling
- Denouement (lessons learned)

Consider Tic-Tac-Toe; it's definitely a game, but the pattern is easily
perceived and there is no continuing variation. Mastery of Tie-Tac-Toe is
quick. Alas, there is a point where patterns become boring and no longer fun.

## Micro-lifecycles

[Tron "The Grid"]

We've explored nostalgia and patterns in popular media such as video games,
movies, and music. What does this have to do with software development?

Generally, software development consists of applying code patterns to problems.
Software developers, or really _any_ artisans of their craft, notice and
remember patterns. They remember which patterns work well and which don't; what
problems those solution-patterns are good fits for and terrible fits for.
Software developers are players in the game of software.

[Tron "I got in"]

People are amazing pattern-matchers. They look for patterns in everything;
sometimes even finding patterns where there wasn't supposed to be, like a cloud
formation. In software, patterns that emerge are often collected into groups.
At the macro-level, these patterns are called architectures, such as MVC
(Model-View-Controller) common in backend frameworks, or MVVM
(Model-View-ViewModel) common in frontend frameworks, or REST (Representational
state transfer) common in web communication.

At the micro-level, it looks like, well... a game. This micro-lifecycle is how every game works. Let's look at the event loop of a game from the perspective of a gamer:

```
+----------------------------------------------------------+

        |                                           |

        |                                      |                |
   +----v--------+    +---------------+        |  🔁  place     |

   |   problem   +---->  preparation  +------->+ +------------+ |
   |             |    |               |        | |    core    | |

                                               | +------------+ |
                                               |                |
                                               +----------------+
```

Let's change some of these words around and apply it to software development.

```
+----------------------------------------------------------+

+-------+-------------------------------------------^------+
        |                                           |

        |                                      |                |
   +----v--------+    +---------------+        |  🔁  test      |
   |             |    |               | write  |                |

                                               | +------------+ |
                                               |                |
                                               +----------------+
```

This looks like test-driven development!

- We're presented a problem
- We prepare for a solution
- Have a test (place)
- Run the logic (core mechanic)
- And adjust according to the feedback we experience.

Software developers and gamers experience the same micro-lifecycles! But let's
call it what it is: it's a pattern at the micro level.

Software development revolves around languages, architectures, and frameworks.
These are all codified patterns with dissertations, white-papers, systems, and
books written about them. Coders leverage these patterns to solve their
problems faster.

Ruby on Rails is considered a really productive and fast framework for the Ruby
language. It introduced the MVC architecture to a lot of young developers. Many
developers of folks find Rails enjoyable; you have to follow the patterns that
they set out to keep progress smooth. PHP Laravel is similar. There are dozens
of frameworks that are aimed to be productive.

It wasn't always like this though. Let's talk about JavaScript.

[image of blurry islands]

Back in the early 2000s, the web looked entirely different. JavaScript, believe
it or not, wasn't as widely used as it is today. It was a mess; different
browsers implemented different features, and sometimes the same feature but with
different interfaces to it. There weren't many patterns. It wasn't as popular
because it wasn't as enjoyable to work within. Think of it as the wild wild
west; only those willing to leave the comforts of what they knew and explore the
unknown would be able to move the language and its ecosystem forward and help
define it.

2006 came around and so did a little library called jQuery, which codified how
to do basic actions in JavaScript. It standardized, unofficially, how to access
elements on the page, how to handle events, how to animate. It was an amazing
contribution to the JavaScript community. It's still used today! jQuery
inspired browser makers and some of those behaviors were codified into the
language properly, and some of those apis are integrated into the browsers now
and work natively without the library.

Several years later in 2010, Google released a framework called Angular (known
as AngularJS now). This was a full framework that applied the MVC and MVVM
architecture to JavaScript.

Years later in 2013, another library called React was released. Together with
other libraries like React Router, Redux and more, it essentially formed a new
framework.

Shortly after in 2014, Vue was released, picking up some loved patterns from
both Angular and React.

These islands of patterns are where developers congregated. Like little
nation-states, they liked their leaders, disliked their leaders, stagnated,
experienced rapid growth, poached employees, etc.

Together, the patterns that these libraries and frameworks introduced helped
make frontend development much more enjoyable. JavaScript today is one of most
prolific languages out there, no doubt in part because patterns emerged.

I think these patterns determine how much fun we're going to have programming.

## Elixir

Let's talk about a software language called Elixir.

[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) is a relatively new functional language.

> Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and
> maintainable applications.

> Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed
> and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web
> development, embedded software, data ingestion, and multimedia processing
> domains.

Elixir is beloved by developers, [particularly seasoned
developers](https://elixirsurvey.typeform.com/report/yYmJv1/OcCCilUmDn8lBpgP),
and I want to explore why. In fact, Elixir is the entire motivation for me to
produce this content.

What makes Elixir so enjoyable? As we have been exploring, fun is the emotional
response to learning, and since people are amazing pattern-matchers, we
constantly look for patterns. Perhaps Elixir has good patterns.

Let's look at some common Elixir programming patterns. These patterns can be
found in many other language. Maybe these patterns are why it's enjoyable to
develop in Elixir?

## Pipelines

When we think about what an application accomplishes, we often frame it in our
minds as a ruleset and transformation of data. That's where we start, at least.

[Railway]

- Data comes in
- Data is transformed
- Data goes out

In Elixir, you can accomplish this with the pipeline operator:

```elixir
"My   String"
|> String.trim()
|> String.replace("My", "Your")
|> String.upcase()
#=> "YOUR STRING"
```

The pipeline starts with a string `"My  String"` and passes it into the first
position of the next function `String.trim/1`. The result of that function is
then passed into the first position of the next function `String.replace(...,
"My", "Your")` and so on until the end when we have the result `"YOUR STRING"`.

Elixir developers reading this are probably already bored. We've seen this pattern a million times. But stick with me!

It doesn't have to be all about transformation either. If at any point, we
wanted to see what the data was between any of those functions, we could also
throw in an `IO.inspect()` between the functions.

```elixir
"My   String"
|> String.trim()
|> IO.inspect(label: "the string is")
|> String.replace("My", "Your")
|> String.upcase()

#=> the string is: "My String"
#=> "YOUR STRING"
```

Move the `IO.inspect` down a little bit...

```elixir
"My   String"
|> String.trim()
|> String.replace("My", "Your")
|> IO.inspect(label: "the string is")
|> String.upcase()

#=> the string is: "Your String"
#=> "YOUR STRING"
```

It's a simple and effective way to see the state of your string as it's passed
through the pipeline.

The pipeline pattern is everywhere in Elixir, and it makes it clear how the
data is being operated upon. We can see instantly that it's being trimmed,
we're replacing a word, and upcasing the string. There's no need to name
interstitial stages of the string while it's being operated upon. Opposed to
this:

```elixir
trimmed_string = String.trim("My String")
replaced_string = String.replace(trimmed_string, "My", "Your")
upcased_string = String.upcase(replaced_string)
```

This is a simple example, but your eyes have to scan to the right to see the
beginning of the data transformation, and then search for where that variable
goes in the next function.

Pipelines are everywhere with Elixir.

The pipeline operator `|>` is not in every language, nor does it need to be in
order to write your code towards data transformation pipelines, but because the
operator exists, it steers developers to work in such a pattern.

Another form of a data pipeline is using the `with` macro. You may have noticed in our simple example about that a string is passed in and out of all the functions; there wasn't a great way to check the output if it was successful; `with` helps with that. Let's look at that in our next pattern:

## Monads (Maybe, Tuple Metadata, Accumulators)

Ok, before I lose you, we're not going to explore what monads are; it doesn't
matter. But, their effect is powerful and I want to explore a pattern that they
enable. If you don't know what a monad is, that's totally fine. Here's a simple
definition: A monad is a unit of data and metadata about the data.

Not to say that Elixir has complete support for academic and mathematical
monads like Haskell, but the Elixir community's code style leans towards using
monads, perhaps without even knowing it.

The best and smallest example I can think of for monads is the Maybe Monad:

```elixir
case this_might_work() do
  {:ok, success_data} ->
    happy_path(success_data)

  {:error, data_about_error} ->
    unhappy_path(data_about_error)
end
```

In Elixir, we're pattern-matching on the result of `this_might_work()`, and
that function returns a maybe monad. The monad in this case is a 2-item tuple.
The tuple begins with either `:ok` or `:error` which is metadata about the
accompanied data.

This is a pervasive pattern in Elixir. I bet that 100% of Elixir codebases out
there have this pattern in it. It's extremely effective in how to route the
data in the pipeline.

Here's another one:

```elixir
with {:ok, burger} <- McDonalds.order("burger"),
     {:ok, fries} <- McDonalds.order("fries"),
     {:ok, milkshake} <- McDonalds.order("milkshake") do
  {:ok, [burger, fries, milkshake]}
else
  {:error, error_message} ->
    Emotions.frustrate()
    Memory.remember(error_message)
    {:error, "did not complete order"}
end
```

Look! We're combining two patterns now: a pipeline and maybe monads. Here, we
are chaining several maybe monads together to form a pipeline with the help of
the `with` macro. Inside the `with` statement:

- order a burger. If you get a burger, then continue
- order some fries. If you get fries, then continue
- order a milkshake. If you get a milkshake, then you're done! Grab your food
  and go!

If they don't have one of the above items, then the pipeline will stop and
return the first encountered error.

The maybe monad is extremely effective in crafting how to route data in
pipelines.

## Happy-path

The previous example includes another pattern: seeing the happy path. I want to
show you a couple of implementations of a process; one in Ruby and another in
Elixir.

```ruby
def order(params)
  user = User.find(params["user_id"])       #| Happy path
  return unless user                        #| Unhappy path

  item = Warehouse.find(params)             #| Happy path
  return unless item                        #| Unhappy path

  money = Billing.charge_user(user, item)   #| Happy path
  return unless money                       #| Unhappy path

  schedule_delivery(user, item)
end
```

In this implementation, I can see that it needs a user, an in-stock item, and
money charged before we schedule a delivery, but visually, I see a mixture of
unhappy and happy paths. It's a little difficult to quickly pick out what the
desired outcomes are supposed to be. Again, this is a simple example;
real-world code is harder than this in many cases.

Let's try this in Elixir using the patterns we've identified earlier:

```elixir
def order(params) do
  with {:ok, user} <- User.find(params),               #|\
       {:ok, item} <- Warehouse.find(params),          #| \ Happy Path
       {:ok, _money} <- Billing.charge(user, item) do  #| /
    schedule_delivery(user, item)                      #|/
  else                                                 #|\
    {:error, _} -> nil                                 #|_\ Unhappy Path
  end
end
```

Here I can see that the happy path is consolidated into one area. I know
exactly what is expected for the process to complete successfully. I also know
where the error cases are handled.

This code focuses on the solution first, which is important because for many
many developers, the first goal is to make it work, then make it fast, then
make it beautiful. With the solution consolidated at the top of the function,
any readers know what makes it work, and where to handle error cases.

Focusing on the solution is important; developers tend to think of what can go
wrong first, and develop for those first. This leads to "gold-plating" your
code before it often sees any real usage. More importantly, this way of
thinking infects other areas of your psyche. It leads to anxiety!

## Totality (Typespecs)

Total functions are functions that give you a valid return value for every
combination of valid arguments. Total functions are really about communication.
In Elixir, this is accomplished with a mixture of pattern matching and
typespecs.

Elixir is NOT a statically-typed language, so it's missing some tools here to
ensure complete totality, but it does have tooling to help with communicating
totality. Elixir can define types, and there's a tool called Dialyzer that can
integrate with your editor of choice that can provide hints to the developer.
[ElixirLS](https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls) is one of those tools.

The pattern of totality in Elixir, in a sense, is simply good documentation.
Developers annotate their code with docs and types to communicate to other
developers what the expected input and output should be, and state guarantees
on how it should work.

A basic example: `String.upcase` expects an input string and outputs a string.
It will always succeed if you give it that input, and will always return to you
a string. It does not lie to you; it's total.

Here's another example:

```elixir
defmodule HeroAction do
  @type hero :: WonderWoman.t() | Batman.t()
  @type baddie :: GenericBaddie.t() | BigBoss.t()
  @type slogan :: String.t()

  @spec fight_criminal(hero(), baddie()) :: {:ok, slogan()}
  def fight_criminal(%WonderWoman{} = hero, %GenericBaddie{} = baddie) do
    %FightScene{
      protagonist: hero,
      antagonist: baddie
    }
    |> beat_up(hero.bracelets_of_submission)
    |> interrogate(hero.lasso_of_truth)
    |> hand_to_police()

    {:ok, "I will fight for those who cannot fight for themselves"}
  end

  def fight_criminal(%Batman{} = hero, %GenericBaddie{} = baddie) do
    %FightScene{
      protagonist: hero,
      antagonist: baddie
    }
    |> beat_up(hero.tools)
    |> interrogate(hero.intimindation)
    |> hand_to_police()

    {:ok, "I am vengence"}
  end

  # ...
end

HeroAction.fight_criminal(batman, criminal)
```

The guarantee of this code is that you're able to hand it anything that matches
the type of `hero` and `baddie`, and you will always get an `{:ok, slogan}` in
return. There are no other possible way this could fail; it's a total function.

Additionally, if you're using an ElixirLS-enabled editor, you can get some
hints while developing:

Communicating with each other is an important part of developing software.
Rarely is software developed by one and only one person, and even if developed
solo, you have your future and past selves to communicate with. Documentation
such typespecs assist you with creating total functions that let you compose
functions safely. That leads us to our final pattern we'll explore today.

## Composition (Functions in the small and large)

Here's the clencher, all the patterns we see above are repeated everywhere.
When you have a big problem to solve with code, you approach it the same exact
way as you would a small problem: with functions. You don't have to shift
paradigms in how to solve a problem depending on its scale.

> OOP has objects in the large, and methods in the small.
> FP has functions in the large, and functions in the small.
> -- Scott Wlaschin (Functional Programming Design Patterns)

This is comforting, because when we already have a business problem we're
trying to solve; we don't need a language problem, or tooling problem clouding
our judgments. Our brains can focus on one thing at a time and "zone out" on
solving the business problem with our familiar and patterned toolset.

## Understood

These patterns are pervasive in almost all Elixir codebases I've seen, and because those patterns are common, developers have a good way to communicate with each other which is the ultimate goal.

We explored nostalgia, which established the positive effect it has on the
person. These patterns of our past remind us of who we used to be or some
aspect of how we identify ourselves.

The Theory of Fun explains that fun is the emotional response to learning; the
reward for continuing to learn. What people learn are patterns in a variety of
settings: adult life, child life, competitions, making mistakes, and video
games which is what we explored.

Software development is chock-full of patterns. Developers apply patterns
constantly to problems they encounter when trying to build something. I focused
on Elixir here, but this is true for many languages and frameworks; some maybe
truer than others.
