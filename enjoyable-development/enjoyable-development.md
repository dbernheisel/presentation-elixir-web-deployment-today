Have you ever read code you _hate?_.
Have you ever read code you _love?_.

We're not talking about _wrong_ code or misunderstood requirements; we're talking about code that accomplishes the job -- you just don't like it.

I do this all the time; usually the first time I write some code, I really don't like it. I accomplish the task, and then I'll do a self-PR review, revise, revise, and then let others PR review the code. I always end up with something I like better, and oftentimes start with something I don't like.

That let me to wonder, "Why do we enjoy some software over other software?" There are some codebases that I come to that I just _hate_, and then there are others that are _lovely_. What makes them different?

A lot of times, we point to languages, frameworks, or the code's testability, like is it easy to get instant feedback on your change? If you know about Rails, then you know that generally when it released, it made MVC architecture in Ruby really enjoyable, compared to what existed before, even outside of Ruby. It made development really enjoyable for a lot of folks. Why?

A typical discussion path from here leads to comparing languages and frameworks as our source of enjoyable software, feature sets vs feature sets; but that would be short-sighted. While frameworks and languages certainly can contribute to enjoyable software, they don't define it. A framework can have a limited feature-set, but _do it really well and be loved_.

I'd like to explore this more psychologically what makes development happy and sad, zealous and angry, smart and dumb. So, let's step outside of the realm of software and explore a concept that everyone generally agrees is enjoyable.

# Music

Everyone listens to music and when you do, you enjoy it! There's no denying it; sure, there are music styles you don't like, but we're not talking about that; we're talking about the music _you_ like. Close your eyes and imagine it now. Classical, rock, hip-hop, pop, or Mongolian throat singing. You can hear it play in your mind; you hum the tune sometimes mindlessly; when doing dishes or laundry, you might beatbox the beat. Music gets us in tune.

[Mario theme start]

Music can imprint a vision in your mind. As proof, you're probably imagining something from Super Mario Bros, right? Maybe not this _exact_ image, but close. Music can transport us into a different time, age, and space.

[Matchbox 20 intro]

This takes me back to my mom's room. I have a small Magnavox boombox sitting on the desk, and I'm playing Final Fantasy 7 on her computer. This was 22 years ago and I remember it.

; especially when you're going through an intensely emotional situation. This symphony of chemicals in your brain calls this a memory; especially in our teenage years. They remind of something we know deeply, perhaps an experience?



Did you know there are patterns in music? Almost every song on the radio has a recognizable pattern of lyrics, whether you've picked it out or not.

Intro, Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus, Outro

If we analyzed the music notes themselves, there are patterns of notes that musicians know sound good together, and some notes when paired together do not sound as good; these notes create dissonance. Musicians know these patterns really well, and sometimes innately. Non-musicians perceive this as musical art, but musicians know the secrets and therefore music is more of a science to them.
